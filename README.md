# Smart India Hackathon Finale Project 2019
An android application for Indoor Navigation using IndoorAtlas API.
## Description
Mobile Application (Android) allows the user to search for products and navigates them to the particular aisle
in which the product is located. This is implemented using Indoor Positioning System(IPS) â€“ chiefly using Magnetic
Localization & BLE Beacons. Magnetic positioning uses magnetic fingerprints to locate smart phones. Implementation
involves 2 steps : 
1. Collecting Magnetic fingerprint (done using an Indoor Positioning API) 
2. Using the location obtained in the form of latitude & longitude (WGS84 format) our application renders Image view using which the customer can
navigate. 
IndoorAtlas's API will be used for localization, Floor plan management, fingerprint collection, map generation and
testing can be done using the API.
